            <p>Chandrayaan-1 was the first lunar space probe of the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) which operated in 2008–09. It found water on the Moon and confirmed the discovery of water locked in minerals on the Moon using NASA’s Moon Minerology Mapper (M 3), an imaging spectrometer.

Chandrayaan-2 was launched in July 2019 and was India’s second lunar exploration mission after Chandrayaan-1. It consisted of an orbiter, a lander named Vikram, and a rover named Pragyan. The mission aimed to study the south polar region of the Moon and gather information about its topography, mineralogy, and exosphere.</p>
